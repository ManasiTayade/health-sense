# Capstone Team 4

## Init


## Design

### Sketch
Main app design using Sketch [link](https://sketch.cloud/s/4WR0Z/v/aMaGqp/)


## Build
### iOS

Clone the code and use Xcode v10+ to build the codebase.
Currently we haven’t added any packages to the build yet, if we do add those, you may need to do a quick 
> pod install
For installing all of the package dependency handled by Cocoapods or Swift Package manager.

## Develop

### iOS
Install Swift Linter for proper code suggestions and we would also incorporate Unit tests as a way to be more compliant with Test driven development, even though this project isn’t designed and developed around TDD principles.


## Workflow

### Best Practices

Every time you would work on your feature of the product always create a new branch with the feature name or ID and then raise a pull request to merge to "develop" branch.

### Code Merge

Master branch is protected so we would work on develop branch for daily work and only commit or merge to "Master" branch for deliverables or feature releases.
Merging to master branch would require one of us to approve the changes.
Pull request needs to be created for reviewing new changes to existing codebase.


## Test
### iOS
We are incorporating Unit tests as our default workflow.
The tests could be found in test branch and tests folder.

## CI/CD

We are utilizing Travis CI for checking our test cases while there is a pull request or master branch code commits.
[Travis CI iOS Doc](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/objective-c/#objective-c-vs-swift)
We are also trying to incorporate Github Actions but there are some hiccups with setting up our Cocoapods and linking with our Xcode build commands. If you could help us the PR is this [Actions](https://github.com/SensehacK/capstone-team4/actions?query=workflow%3ASwift)
[PR](https://github.com/SensehacK/capstone-team4/pull/19)

## Issues

We would use JIRA, Git Issues or any Issue tracker.

## Timeline
Schedule for deliverables.
