# Capstone Team 4

## Init

## Build

## Develop

## Merge

Master branch is protected so we would work on develop branch for daily work and only commit or merge to "Master" branch for deliverables or feature releases.
Merging to master branch would require one of us to approve the changes.
Pull request needs to be created for reviewing new changes to existing codebase.

## Best Practices

Every time you would work on your feature of the product always create a new branch with the feature name or ID and then raise a pull request to merge to "develop" branch.

## Test

## Issues

We would use JIRA, Git Issues or any Issue tracker.

## Progress

Schedule for deliverables.
